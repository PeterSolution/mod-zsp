JAP.114.desc:0 "Democratic elements in the government have instigated a surprise take-over of the country, after the military threatened to once again curb the people's hard-gained democratic rights. With a surprising alacrity, a significant portion of the military has taken up arms in defense of the people and their rights to liberty.\n\nThis split in the military has allowed for the people's representatives to seize power in the legislative and executive branches.

Faced with the sudden and overwhelming nature of events, as well as rebel control of the palace, the Emperor has made no move to denounce the rebels.\n\nOrganized government resistance seems already to crumble, and the rebels are expected at any time to announce the establishment of total Imperial control to all areas of domestic, foreign, and military policy. Emperor Hirihito has become disillusioned with the leadership of the military and the Prime Ministers and will assume complete control of the government."
